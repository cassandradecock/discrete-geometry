The function orbitsize(X,n,v) takes as inputs:
X='A' 'D' 'H' 'E' or 'F'
n=dimension of the group
v=vector for which you want to know the orbit size (optional)

It first computes the generating matrix of the required dimension n

Then if the input v is not given it computes a vector out of any hyperplane of the group.

Lastly it computes all the different images of v under the selected group and returns the size of the orbit.

*It has problems in decimal numbers when comparing vectors,in particular with the group H4 and E8
