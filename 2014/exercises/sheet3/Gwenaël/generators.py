'''
The following routines return the generators of some given Coxeter group (A,D,E,F,H). The pre and post-conditions
are generically defined as :
@input: A number n which represent the dimension of space in which the reflections are considered. If such a group
        does not exists in dimension n, then the routine return a error message.
@output: A list of array which generate the Coxeter group of dimension n.
