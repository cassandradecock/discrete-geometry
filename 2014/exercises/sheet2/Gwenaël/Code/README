	- The function chi solve the problem of determining if two tetrahedron are lattice 
      equivalent. Before calling this function, you must create some file containing the 
      coordinates of the vertices of your tetrahedron. The pathname of these files has 
      to be passed as arguments.
	- The files matrix_P1, matrix_Q1, matrix_P2, matrix_Q2 are selected examples for 
	  this function.
	- The files result_1 and resultat_2 are the file obtained by runing test_chi.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS
The function chi call several secondary usefull method, as Determinant or comatrix. 
These routines have been written in separate files, for suitable further usage.
